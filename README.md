Data analysis of Twitter big data using Python


STEPS FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS IN TWITTER

Abstract

Perform real-time data analysis of Twitter data using a pipeline built on Google compute engine , Kubernetes, Redis and Big Query. Identifying general patterns and trends in data. Google Big query is a data analysis tool, which can crunch terabytes of data on demand in seconds using expensive in â€“memory technology. Extensively inside of google for analyzing large data sets and log file for year and it also available externally.


Requirements- 

PYTHON 2.7-PYTHON 3.5(latest)
Cloud based application - Wakari IO , IBM Bluemix , AWS
Database - Redis


Run the code in cloud based platform , in the form of notebook.

import required packages , modules,
create the twitter id- Goto-> application/product development get the consumer key and consumer secret key and give to the code ,
that is replace my KEY and ID ,
consumerKey = 'iPIcJAmPTQYiEZ3FF01iuVcvI'
consumerSecret = '8P39msYkvZHdP4wxbhtl7GhFvUfAlJVSMPMTQJRAQr2ESDUbxR'

Run the code , get the ouput , store the information using REDIS( Cloud based database) , sqlite3 can also used in python.
Analyze the output , store the Data , access the data , manipulate the data using Big query
